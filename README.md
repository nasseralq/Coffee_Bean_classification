The third project at SDAIA bootcamp T5 by using calssification. 
(Data science, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning).


# A B S T R A C T
Proceeding from the vision of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2030 and its
announcement of the Quality of Life Program, which aims to raise the
level of citizenâ€™s well-being by creating the appropriate environment for
this, one of the most important goals is to raise the number of cafes
from 171 per million people to 1032 per million people by 2030.
Data was taken for a number of coffee crops in a number of famous
countries in the field and the coffee quality was predicted. In the future,
entrepreneurs in the field of coffee will be contacted, and the project
will be presented and developed according to customer needs.

# DESIGN
By applying the dataset on machine learning models such as
LogisticRegression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Voting, and
Bagging.
# DATA
The dataset contains 2650 crops with 44 features for each.. A few
feature highlights include Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body,
Balance, Uniformity, Clean.Cup, Sweetness, Cupper.Points,
Total_Cup_Points, and Moisture.
# ALGORITHMS 
Preparing the data and feature selection:
Methods:
1. Exploration of the data and visualization.
2. Feature Selection by calculating the
correlation of the features.
LogisticRegression, KNN, Decision Tree,
Random Forest, Voting, and Bagging. Splitting
the dataset by using cross validation to
measure each model score.


# TOOLS
Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Numpy and Pandas for data
manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
visualization.
Sklearn for ML algorithms.
Imblearn to solve imbalance problem.
